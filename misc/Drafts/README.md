# Drafts
This directory serves as a space for planning, ideation, and initial design of the language's syntax and core features. Additionally, it's where the implementation of the standard library is outlined. Think of this area as a sandbox for experimenting with language concepts before they become finalized.


## Purpose
The `drafts/` directory is dedicated to the following activities:

- Syntax Planning: Here, you'll find mock Iridis source code samples that help me visualize and plan out the language's syntax. These examples serve as blueprints for how the language's structure and expressions might look.
- Language Features: Experiment with and define language features, data structures, and paradigms that will shape the core of the Iridis language. I use this area to sketch out ideas and concepts.
- Standard Library Design: The standard library is a crucial part of any programming language. In this directory, you'll find plans and outlines for the functions, modules, and utilities that will be included in the Iridis standard library.
