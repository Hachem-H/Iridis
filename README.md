# Iridis

A Fast, Modern, Low-Level General-Purpose Programming Language

Iridis is an innovative programming language designed to cater to the needs of various domains, such as computational physics, kernel development, and game development, while remaining versatile enough to be applicable in many other areas. This language is built from the ground up to offer blazing fast performance, a modern development experience, and low-level control, empowering programmers to tackle complex problems efficiently and effectively.

## Note
Iridis is still in its very very early stages, as in, I barely have a functional compiler yet. I am focusing mainly on language design before implementing everything to make sure everything looks fine and I wouldnt have to re-implement a large portion of the compiler simply to add a new large language feature. My development pace does vary a lot due to the concurrent management of several ongoing projects, both related and un-related to computer science.

At this current point in time, project development has seized as I am focusing on other projects of which I am finding myself more motivated to work.
