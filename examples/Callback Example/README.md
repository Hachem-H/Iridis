Sure! Let's provide more details on what a callback is and how it is used in programming.

# Callback Example

In this example, we will explore how to implement callbacks in the Iridis programming language. A callback is a programming concept where a function or procedure is passed as an argument to another function or procedure. The receiving function can then call the passed function at a specific point during its execution.

Callbacks are commonly used in situations where you want to customize or extend the behavior of a function or module without modifying its original code. They are widely employed in various programming domains, such as game development, networking, event handling, and asynchronous programming.

## Defining the Callback

Let's start by defining a procedure called `HandleCallback`. This procedure takes in another procedure as an argument, which will serve as the callback function:

```iridis
HandleCallback :: proc(callback: proc(i32, i32) -> i32) -> i32
{
    someNumber := 1
    someOtherNumber := 2

    return callback(someNumber, someOtherNumber)
}
```

In this example, `HandleCallback` takes a callback procedure that expects two `i32` arguments and returns an `i32`. The `::` operator is used to declare `HandleCallback` as a constant procedure.

## Implementing the Callback

Now, let's define an example procedure called `SomeProcedure`, which will serve as our callback:

```iridis
SomeProcedure :: proc(num1: i32, num2: i32) -> i32
{
    num1 *= 2
    num2 /= 3
    return num1 + num2
}
```

The `SomeProcedure` takes two `i32` arguments, `num1` and `num2`, performs some calculations on them, and returns the result as an `i32`.

## Using the Callback

To use the `HandleCallback` procedure with our defined `SomeProcedure` as the callback, we do the following:

```iridis
io :: import!("std.io")

HandleCallback :: proc(callback: proc(i32, i32) -> i32) -> i32
{
    someNumber := 1
    someOtherNumber := 2
    return callback(someNumber, someOtherNumber)
}

main :: proc()
{
    someProcedure :: proc(num1: i32, num2: i32) -> i32
    {
        num1 *= 2
        num2 /= 3
        return num1 + num2
    }

    result := HandleCallback(someProcedure)
    io.println("Callback result: {}", result)
}
```

In the `main` procedure, we define `someProcedure` as a local procedure, and then we call `HandleCallback` passing `someProcedure` as the callback argument. The `HandleCallback` procedure will execute the passed callback (`someProcedure` in this case) with specific arguments and return the result, which is then printed using the `io.println()` function.

## Conclusion

In this example, we have explored the concept of callbacks in the Iridis programming language. Callbacks provide a powerful way to customize and extend the behavior of functions and modules, promoting code reusability and flexibility in various programming scenarios. To further understand and experiment with callbacks, you can refer to the `main.iridis` file where the code is commented with additional explanations. Happy coding!
